Why did you choose MongoDB over SQL or other databases for this project?

ðŸ”¹ MongoDB (NoSQL)

Flexible schema â†’ easy to evolve.

Stores documents (JSON-like).

Great for unstructured/semi-structured data.

Scales horizontally (handles huge data & traffic).


Best for real-time apps, IoT, analytics, fast prototyping.

ðŸ”¹ RDBMS (MySQL/Postgres/Oracle)

Strict schema â†’ strong consistency & integrity.

Stores rows in tables with predefined columns.

Great for structured & relational data.

Scales vertically (but can shard/cluster with effort).

Best for banking, finance, ERP, apps with complex relationships.

What are the main advantages of using React for your frontend?

React was one of the first to popularize component-based architecture and still has one of the largest ecosystems and best tooling available for frontend development.

First of all, React is a mature JavaScript library that is widely used by developers because of its excellent features:

- **Component-Based Architecture:** You write a component once and can reuse it anywhere in your app. This makes code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
- **React DevTools:** A browser extension that helps you inspect the component tree, props, and state in real time. It also includes a Profiler tab to analyze component render times and performance, making it easier to debug and optimize your app.
- **Hot Reloading:** When you save changes to your code, only the changed components update in the browserâ€”without a full page reload. This means you see UI changes instantly, and your appâ€™s state (like form inputs or navigation) is preserved, speeding up development.
- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that change, resulting in fast rendering and a smooth user experience.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data flows in one direction, making state management predictable and debugging easier.
- **Rich Ecosystem & Community:** There are thousands of libraries and tools (like React Router, Recharts, Context API) that integrate seamlessly with React, and a large community for support.

Other modern frameworks (like Vue and Angular) now have similar features, but React was one of the first to make them popular and still leads in ecosystem size and developer support.
